- Title:
Extended Fourier Transformation - A New Perspective Connecting Real Space and Fock Space

<!--more-->
Abstract:

In this seminar, we extend the ordinary Fourier transformation within real spaces to a transformation between real space and Fock space (constructed via creation operators).
The coordinates and derivatives in the original space correspond to the creation and annihilation operators, respectively.
This approach was developed in the study of higher-spin and continuous-spin theories, where it plays a key role in exploring connections to string theory.
We will begin with an overview of how this extended Fourier transformation emerged in our research, followed by a detailed explanation focusing on practical calculation methods.
Rather than delving into rigorous mathematical frameworks, the emphasis will be on its applicability in physics through concrete examples.
As this is a newly discovered method, we welcome comments and discussions on its properties and potential connections to other fields.
