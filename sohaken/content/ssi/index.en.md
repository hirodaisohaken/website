# Introduction

The Setouchi Summer Institute (SSI) is a workshop that brings together particle- and hadron-physics groups from universities in the Setouchi (Seto Inland Sea) region. The goal is to foster closer ties through invited lectures, research presentations, and related activities. Held annually over three or four days in late August to September, the meeting typically involves around 40 participants.
This year, with the aim of nurturing early-career researchers and promoting researcher exchange in particle and hadron physics across the Chugoku and Shikoku regions, we will hold “SSI 2025” as follows.

# Schedule / Venue

# Invited Lecture
## 9/25 (Thu)
Divided into two 90-minute parts with a 1.5-hour lunch break in between.
- 10:00 ~ 11:30 13:00 ~ 14:30
    - Lecture 1 (Chair: Takuya Morozumi)
    - Lecturer: Ryuichiro Kitano (Kyoto University, Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics)
    - Title: Particle Phenomenology
    - Abstract: This lecture will cover various topics in particle phenomenology. The Standard Model consists of QED, QCD, and electroweak interactions, yet mysteries remain throughout, and research continues toward deeper understanding. Though the theory is largely complete and experimentally verified, little room seems left for major reconstruction. Why, then, are researchers not content to declare it complete? Following the discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC, particle theory has entered a period of confusion. This talk will consider its future direction.

## 9/26 (Fri)
Divided into two 90-minute parts with a 1.5-hour lunch break in between.
- 10:00 ~ 11:30 13:00 ~ 14:30
    - Lecture 2 (Chair: Chiho Nonaka)
    - Lecturer: Hidetoshi Taya (Keio University)
    - Title: Fundamentals of strong-field physics and its applications to heavy-ion physics
    - Abstract: Under extreme conditions known as “strong fields,” fascinating phenomena occur that are impossible in ordinary environments. Such strong-field physics is not only expected to be experimentally verified using high-intensity lasers but is also important for understanding astrophysical and high-energy environments such as neutron stars, heavy-ion collisions, and the early universe. Targeted primarily at graduate students, this lecture will discuss: (1) an overview of strong-field physics and its theoretical foundations, including the Schwinger mechanism and particle production, and (2) its applications to strong electromagnetic and color fields in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions.
